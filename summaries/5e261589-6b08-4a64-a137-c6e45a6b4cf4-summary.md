The Acquisition Agreement outlined in the document is a formal contract between adsfeed.io, referred to as the Seller, and FastTec B.V., referred to as the Buyer. The agreement, dated 29 June, establishes the terms under which adsfeed.io agrees to sell, and FastTec B.V. agrees to purchase specific assets. These assets include two products: Billion VPN and Thunder VPN, encompassing all their source code, documentation, trademarks, customer data, and other related intellectual property. The document meticulously details the assets involved, the purchase price, payment terms, transfer of ownership, representations and warranties of both parties, confidentiality obligations, governing law, the entirety of the agreement, amendment provisions, and the requirement for signatures to validate the agreement.

The total purchase price for the assets is set at $12,500, to be paid by the Buyer in two equal installments. The first installment of $6,250 is due upfront upon the execution of the agreement, and the second installment of the same amount is due upon delivery and completion of the transfer of the assets. The agreement specifies a closing date of 1 July by which the transfer of the assets should be completed, marking the point at which all rights, title, and interest in the assets will be transferred from the Seller to the Buyer.

Both parties make several representations and warranties within the agreement. The Seller guarantees that it is the sole owner of the assets being sold, that these assets are free from any encumbrances, and that it has the full right and authority to sell and transfer the assets. Conversely, the Buyer assures that it has the full right and authority to purchase the assets, underscoring the legal and rightful transfer of ownership under the terms outlined.

A significant section of the agreement is dedicated to confidentiality, emphasizing that both parties are committed to maintaining the secrecy of the agreement's terms and any proprietary information exchanged during the transaction. This clause ensures that sensitive details of the transaction and the assets involved are protected from disclosure outside the agreement's scope.

The document specifies that the agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of the UK, indicating the legal jurisdiction that will oversee any disputes or interpretations of the agreement. It also states that this document constitutes the entire agreement between the parties, superseding all prior negotiations, agreements, and understandings related to the subject matter. Any amendments to the agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties, ensuring that any changes to the terms are formally agreed upon.

Finally, the agreement concludes with a section for signatures from both parties, indicating their consent and commitment to the terms outlined. The document is signed by Georgi Mamelyan on behalf of adsfeed.io and anticipates a signature from FastTec B.V., thereby formalizing the acquisition under the terms agreed upon by both parties. This signature section is a critical component, legally binding both parties to the agreement and its execution as of the date first written.

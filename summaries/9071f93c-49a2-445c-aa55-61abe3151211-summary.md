The Acquisition Agreement outlines the terms under which adsfeed.io, the seller, agrees to sell, and FastTec B.V., the buyer, agrees to purchase certain assets for a total of $12,500. These assets include Billion VPN and Thunder VPN, encompassing all related source code, documentation, trademarks, customer data, and intellectual property. The payment is structured in two equal installments, with half due upon the agreement's execution and the remainder upon the assets' transfer completion, scheduled by 1 July.

The agreement specifies that the seller is the sole owner of the assets, free of encumbrances, and has the authority to sell them, while the buyer has the authority to purchase them. It includes provisions for maintaining confidentiality regarding the agreement's terms and proprietary information exchanged during the transaction. The agreement is governed by UK law and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties, superseding all prior negotiations and agreements. Any amendments to the agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties. The document concludes with a section for signatures from both the seller and the buyer, confirming their agreement to the terms outlined.

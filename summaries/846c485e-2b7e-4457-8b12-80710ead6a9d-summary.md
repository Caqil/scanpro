These assets include Billion VPN and Thunder VPN, encompassing all related source code, documentation, trademarks, customer data, and intellectual property. The payment is structured in two equal installments of $6,250, with the first payment due upon the execution of the agreement and the second upon the completion of the asset transfer by the closing date of 1 July.

The agreement specifies that the seller guarantees they are the sole owner of the assets and have the authority to sell them, ensuring the assets are free from encumbrances. Similarly, the buyer confirms their authority to make the purchase. Both parties commit to maintaining the confidentiality of the agreement's terms and any proprietary information exchanged during the transaction. The document is governed by UK law and stipulates that any amendments to the agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. The agreement concludes with a section for signatures from both the seller and the buyer, marking their consent and execution of the terms as of 29 June.

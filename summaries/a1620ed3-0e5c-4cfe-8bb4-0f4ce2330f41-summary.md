The Acquisition Agreement documented outlines the terms under which adsfeed.io, the Seller, agrees to sell specific assets to FastTec B.V., the Buyer. This agreement was formalized on 29 June, with the parties' addresses and contact information clearly stated, establishing the geographical and communication context for the transaction.

The core of the agreement revolves around the sale and purchase of two primary assets: Billion VPN and Thunder VPN. These assets encompass all source code, documentation, trademarks, customer data, and other related intellectual property. The total purchase price for these assets is set at $12,500, to be paid in two equal installments. The first installment is due upon the execution of the agreement, and the second is to be paid upon the delivery and completion of the transfer of the assets.

The agreement specifies a closing date for the transfer of the assets as 1 July. It mandates that upon receipt of the full purchase price, the seller is to transfer all rights, title, and interest in and to the assets to the buyer. This clause ensures a clear transition of ownership from the seller to the buyer, contingent upon the agreed financial transaction.

Both parties make significant representations and warranties within the agreement. The seller guarantees that they are the sole owner of the assets, that the assets are free from any encumbrances, and that they have the authority to sell and transfer these assets. Conversely, the buyer asserts their authority to purchase the assets, ensuring that both parties are legally capable of entering into and fulfilling the agreement.

Confidentiality is a critical component of the agreement, with both parties committing to keep the terms of the agreement and any exchanged proprietary information confidential. This clause is standard in such agreements to protect the business interests and intellectual property involved.

The agreement is governed by the laws of the State of the UK, indicating the legal jurisdiction that will resolve any disputes or interpret the terms of the agreement. This choice of governing law establishes the legal framework and principles that will guide the interpretation and enforcement of the agreement's terms.

Finally, the document concludes that it represents the entire agreement between the parties, superseding all prior negotiations, agreements, and understandings related to the subject matter. Any amendments to the agreement must be made in writing and signed by both parties, ensuring that any changes are mutually agreed upon and formally documented. The agreement is validated by the signatures of representatives from both adsfeed.io and FastTec B.V., marking their official commitment to the terms laid out in the document.

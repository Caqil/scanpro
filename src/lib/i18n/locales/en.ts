      whatCanRepair: {
        question: "What types of PDF issues can be fixed?",
        answer: "Our repair tool can fix a wide range of problems including corrupted file structures, broken page references, damaged content streams, missing cross-reference tables, and invalid objects. It can often recover content from PDFs that won't open or display correctly in standard PDF viewers."
      },
      completelyDamaged: {
        question: "Can you repair completely damaged PDFs?",
        answer: "While our advanced repair mode can recover content from severely damaged PDFs, a 100% recovery isn't always possible if the file is completely corrupted. However, even in extreme cases, we can often recover partial content, especially text and basic elements."
      },
      contentQuality: {
        question: "Will repairing affect content quality?",
        answer: "No, our repair process maintains the quality of recoverable content. Unlike some tools that simply extract and recreate PDFs (which can lose formatting), we attempt to preserve the original structure while fixing only the corrupted parts."
      },
      passwordProtected: {
        question: "Can you repair password-protected PDFs?",
        answer: "Yes, you can repair password-protected PDFs if you have the password. You'll need to enter the password during the repair process. We do not, however, attempt to bypass or remove encryption from protected documents without proper authorization."
      },
      dataSecurity: {
        question: "Is my PDF data secure during the repair process?",
        answer: "Yes, we take data security seriously. Your files are processed securely on our servers, not shared with third parties, and are automatically deleted after processing. We use encryption for all file transfers, and the entire repair process happens in a secure environment."
